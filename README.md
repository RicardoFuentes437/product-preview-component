## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I really liked this challenge because i got to practice concepts like CSS Grid, Flexbox and i got to incorporate JavaScript to make certain functions work.

### Continued development

Making a web site responsive is still kind of difficult for me, because everything needs to look good and everything needs to be in the right place in all of the different screen sizes, but hopefully with practice i can improve this part.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand more how flexbox works and all the different options i have when i'm working with it.
- [CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing guide where you can learn and go over all the concepts regarding CSS Grid.
